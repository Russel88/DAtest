DAtest
======
DAtest is a package for comparing different differential abundance methods used in microbial marker-gene (e.g. 16S rRNA), RNA-seq and protein/metabolite abundance analysis.

There are many methods for testing differential abundance and no gold standard, but results can vary a lot between the different statistical methods. This package aims at aiding the analyst in choosing a method for a specific dataset based on empirical testing.
